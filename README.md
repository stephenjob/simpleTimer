# simpleTimer

My first attempt building a small, basic application in JavaScript. I use it when I would like to time myself for any activities such as doing office work, or while taking a break. It also reminds me to stand up and stretch for a while, and to drink water. 

Features:
* Run it by setting the timer in minutes. 
* You can play a mp3 while it's running. It can be configured in audio tag in index.html
* The page background can be configured in style.css
